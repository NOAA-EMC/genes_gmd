Example scripts to create a regional 10' grid (Alaska) and a global (30') grid. Also provided is an script to modify the mask file when the regional grid is
nested inside the global grid and only part of the regional grid is active
(given by a polygon defined in alaska_10minzone.ascii). 

NOTE 1 : The path names at the top of the scripts will have to be changed to 
         the appropriate directories

NOTE 2:  The algorithms test for grids wrapping around in longitude but not in
         lattitude. So do not build grids that extend from -90 S to 90 N
